# SimpleRaspberryPiPython
This is a collection of simple python scripts to get started with the Raspberry Pi. These were written for beginners by a beginner (I'm not an expert). 

-The libraries you need:                                                                                                      
To the latest date,(January 11th, 2016) you will need the "RPi.GPIO" library and the "time" library. To install these libraries, you will need to run "sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio" and then run "sudo apt-get install python-time"

-How to run the program:                                                                                                      
To run the program on your Raspberry Pi, you must go into Leafpad (the text editor) in the main menu. Name the file, it can be anything just make sure that at the end you put ".py" at the end. Once you have copied the code from one of the files above, paste it into the text editor. Go into your terminal program and run "sudo python-[filename].py" and press enter. If you get an error message, make sure that you have installed the libraries as described above.
